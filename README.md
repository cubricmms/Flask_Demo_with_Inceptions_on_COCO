  Flask And TensorFlow Serving using Docker
</h1>

<p align="center">
  The project is a Flask backend serving objection detection apis provided from TensorFlow serving. Both are deployed using Docker. A live demo can be found at <a href="http://68.183.188.102:5000">DigitalOcean</a>.

## Project Overview

**Flask And Tensorflow Serving using Docker** is using [**Flask**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) as backend server, [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org) as database, [**TensorFlow Serving**](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/serving/docker) as image detection service.

The project is replying on [**SQLAlchemy**](https://www.sqlalchemy.org) and [**Flask-Migrate**](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to manage tables.

[**Flask-Uploads**](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Uploads/) and [**Flask-Dropzone**](https://flask-dropzone.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) are used for handling image uploads. And the Flask-Uploads manages image datastore while Flask-Dropzone handling frontend js.

[**Flask-Login**](https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is for user registration, login and logout, and api authorizations. Currently functions like email confirmations are not implemented in this demo.

## Prerequisite
#### Running Directly
For running demo without Docker, you need Python 3.6 or later and PostgreSQL database set up accordingly. To setup Tensorflow Serving, you can find more details at this <a href="https://medium.com/@pierrepaci/deploy-tensorflow-object-detection-model-in-less-than-5-minutes-604e6bb0bb04">Medium</a> post.

Install dependencies listed in the requirements by `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Inside the app folder, execute `Flask db upgrade` and `Flask run` or `python run.py`. After defining environment variables needed for configuration, you should be able to see a Flask instance up and running.

#### Running using Docker
If you are running demo with Docker (recommended), you can clone this project and do the following:
```bash
$ cd Flask_Demo_with_Inceptions_on_COCO/
$ sh launch.sh
```
In another terminal tab, initialize database on the first time:
```bash
$ cd Flask_Demo_with_Inceptions_on_COCO/
$ sh init_db.sh
```

Another note: Please change demo > pg > configuration.py
`UPLOADS_DEFAULT_URL = 'http://<your ip address>:5000/static/img/'`. Ex. On you local machine, replace the ip address with `localhost`. Same for `UPLOADED_PHOTOS_URL`.
